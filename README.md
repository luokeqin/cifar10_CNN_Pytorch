# cifar10_CNN_Pytorch
First attempt in the creation of a CNN for cifar10 dataset. This dataset have 10 different attributes. The CNN have three convolutional layers, with a MaxPooling of (2x2) and a Dropout of 0.25. Also, after the CNN it have two Linear Layers. The first one with 1024 input and 500 output, second one with 500 input and 10 output.
The accuracy of this CNN was of 74%.
